1. Abstraction - It refers to the concept of hiding the complexities of a system from the users of that system.
2. Attributes - They are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance.
3. Class - It is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods)
4. Class variable is any variable declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist.
5. Composition - It describes a class that references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables.
6. Encapsulation - It describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit.
7. Friends - It is a function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data.
8. Inheritance - It is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.
9. Instance variable - It is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.
10. Member Variable - It is a variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods (member functions).
11. Method - It is a procedure associated with a class. It also defines the behavior of the objects that are created from the class.
12. Multiple Inheritance - It is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class.
13. Object - It is a component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the program.
14. Overloading - It occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
15. Polymorphism - It refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. 
16. Public / Private / Protected - Public means everyone is allowed to access, Private means that only members of the same class are allowed to access, and Protected means that members of subclasses are also allowed.
17. Virtual - It is a member function that you expect to be redefined in derived classes.
